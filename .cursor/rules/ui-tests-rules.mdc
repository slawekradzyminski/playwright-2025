description: Use this rule always when you write UI tests
alwaysApply: false
---
- Use Page Object Model (POM) pattern to write UI tests, add pages to pages/ folder, add components to pages/components/ folder
- Use data-testid based selectors (frontend should be prepared for this)
- Frontend is running on http://localhost:8081
- Use Playwright MCP to find data-testid based selectors
- When you write UI tests you should always execute them to make sure they work as expected
- To run tests from single file use npx playwright test tests/ui/home.ui.spec.ts (replace home.ui.spec.ts with the file you want to run)
