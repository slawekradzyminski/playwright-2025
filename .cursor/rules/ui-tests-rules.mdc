description: Use this rule always when you write UI tests
alwaysApply: false

- Use Page Object Model (POM) pattern to write UI tests, add pages to pages/ folder, add components to pages/components/ folder
- Use data-testid based selectors (frontend should be prepared for this)
- Frontend is running on http://localhost:8081
- Use Playwright MCP to find data-testid based selectors
- Use npm run test:ui to run UI tests
