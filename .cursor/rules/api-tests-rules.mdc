### Backend API
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:4001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:4001/v3/api-docs

## Testing Structure

### API Tests
- Located in tests/api directory
- Example [login.api.spec.ts](mdc:tests/api/login.api.spec.ts)

## Authentication

### TypeScript Types
When dealing with objects create custom types in types folder.

## Playwright Configuration

### Test Configuration
- Configuration file: [playwright.config.ts](mdc:playwright.config.ts)
- Parallel execution enabled

### Test Patterns
- Use given/when/then comments structure
- API tests ordered by response code (200 → 400 → 401 → 403 → 404)

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Best Practices
- API tests use request context for backend testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for both positive and negative scenarios
