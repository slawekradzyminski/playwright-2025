## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure Requirements
- Follow given/when/then pattern with comments
- Use Page Object Model for all screens
- Implement comprehensive accessibility testing
- Test responsive design across devices
- Use modern TypeScript syntax

### Authentication Strategy
- Use existing `ui.auth.fixture.ts` for authenticated screens
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated access
- Verify proper redirects for unauthorized access

### Test Categories per Screen
- **Layout & UI**: Element visibility, responsive design, accessibility
- **Functionality**: Core features, form submissions, data interactions

- **Error Handling**: Validation messages, error states, recovery
- **Performance**: Load times, interaction responsiveness
- **Security**: Access control, data protection, input sanitization

### Required Artifacts per Screen
1. **Page Object**: TypeScript class in `/pages` directory
2. **Test Spec**: Comprehensive test suite in `/tests/ui`
3. **Fixtures**: Authentication and data setup as needed
4. **Types**: TypeScript interfaces for screen-specific data
