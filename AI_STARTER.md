Familiarise yourself with the project, read example tests and @README.md and your rules

Refactor @login.ui.spec.ts to @Playwright best practice called Page Object Model
@https://playwright.dev/docs/pom 

Create LoginPage in pages folder (folder was just created by me)

After refactor run the tests by yourself and make sure they pass. In case of failure iterate with fixes. To debug you can use Playwright MCP server.
