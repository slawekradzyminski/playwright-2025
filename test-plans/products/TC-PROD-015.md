# TC-PROD-015: Error Handling and Edge Case Testing

**Test Case ID:** TC-PROD-015  
**Title:** Verify Products Page Handles Errors and Edge Cases Gracefully  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Test Type:** Error Handling  
**Category:** Error Handling  

## Prerequisites
- User must be logged in
- Ability to simulate network errors or server issues
- Test environment should allow for error condition simulation

## Test Steps
1. Navigate to Products page
2. Simulate network disconnection during page load
3. Test behavior when product images fail to load
4. Simulate server error responses (500, 503)
5. Test with empty product database
6. Simulate slow server responses
7. Test session timeout during page interaction
8. Verify error messages are user-friendly
9. Test recovery when network connection is restored
10. Verify page doesn't break with malformed data
11. Test graceful degradation when JavaScript is disabled

## Expected Results
- Appropriate error messages are displayed for network issues
- Broken images are handled gracefully with placeholders
- Server errors show user-friendly error pages
- Empty product state is handled with appropriate messaging
- Loading states are shown during slow responses
- Session timeout is handled with proper redirection
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Page recovers gracefully when issues are resolved
- Basic functionality works without JavaScript

## Things to Watch Out For
- Technical error messages exposed to users
- Page breaking completely on errors
- No feedback during loading or error states
- Poor recovery from error conditions
- Confusing or unhelpful error messages
- Security information leaked in error messages
