# TC-PROD-012: Page Performance and Load Time Testing

**Test Case ID:** TC-PROD-012  
**Title:** Verify Products Page Loads Within Acceptable Time Limits  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Test Type:** Performance  
**Category:** Performance  

## Prerequisites
- User must be logged in
- Network connection must be stable
- Browser developer tools must be available for performance monitoring
- Test environment should have realistic data volumes

## Test Steps
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Navigate to login page
3. Log in with valid credentials
4. Start performance monitoring in browser dev tools
5. Navigate to Products page
6. Measure time to first contentful paint
7. Measure time to interactive
8. Measure total page load time
9. Check network requests and response times
10. Verify image loading performance
11. Test with slow network conditions (throttling)
12. Monitor memory usage during page interaction

## Expected Results
- Page loads within 3 seconds on normal connection
- First contentful paint occurs within 1.5 seconds
- Page becomes interactive within 2 seconds
- Images load progressively without blocking page
- Network requests are optimized and minimal
- Page remains responsive during loading
- Memory usage stays within reasonable limits
- Performance is acceptable on slow connections

## Things to Watch Out For
- Slow database queries affecting load time
- Large image files causing delays
- Excessive network requests
- Memory leaks during page interactions
- Poor performance on mobile devices
- Blocking JavaScript affecting page responsiveness
